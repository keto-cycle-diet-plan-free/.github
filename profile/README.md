## What Is the Keto Cycle Diet Plan?

The **Keto Cycle Diet** (also known as **Cyclical Ketogenic Diet - CKD**) is a variation of the standard ketogenic diet (SKD). Instead of maintaining a **constant** state of ketosis, you strategically **reintroduce carbohydrates** on certain days. This approach aims to provide flexibility, improve muscle performance, and make the keto diet more sustainable in the long run.

### How Does Keto Cycling Work?
Keto cycling follows a weekly pattern where you alternate between **keto days** and **carb refeed days**. A typical keto cycle might look like this:

- **5 Days Keto:** 70-80% fats, 10-20% protein, 5-10% carbohydrates.
- **2 Days Carb Refeed:** 50-60% carbohydrates, 20-30% protein, 10-20% fat.

On keto days, your body burns fat for fuel. On refeed days, you replenish glycogen levels, helping maintain metabolism and preventing plateaus.

## Benefits of the Keto Cycle Diet Plan

1. **Enhances Fat Burning**  
   Cycling between low-carb and carb days helps the body efficiently switch between fat-burning and carb-burning, maximizing weight loss.

2. **Prevents Metabolic Slowdown**  
   Continuous low-carb intake may lead to metabolic adaptation. Carbohydrate refeed days prevent this by resetting metabolic functions.

3. **Supports Muscle Growth & Performance**  
   Carb refeed days help replenish **glycogen stores**, essential for muscle recovery and strength.

4. **Reduces Keto Flu Symptoms**  
   Keto flu occurs due to low electrolyte levels and lack of carbs. Cycling prevents excessive depletion, making adaptation easier.

5. **Sustains Long-Term Adherence**  
   Many people struggle to maintain strict ketosis. Cycling offers flexibility, making it a sustainable lifestyle.

6. **Boosts Mental Clarity**  
   While ketosis enhances focus, cycling carbs prevents cognitive fatigue associated with prolonged carb restriction.
